# Next.js WebDev Project with NextAuth, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and TurboRepo

Welcome to our Next.js web development project! This project utilizes Next.js for both frontend and backend, integrates NextAuth for authentication, PostgreSQL for the database, Prisma for database management and migration, and TurboRepo for creating a mono repository structure.

## Project Structure

- **`/user-app`**: Main application for user management, payments, and transactions.
- **`/bank-webhook`**: Demo server to simulate bank transfers for our application.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine (version `>= 12.0.0` recommended)
- PostgreSQL database instance
- `.env` file with the following environment variables:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url_here
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Navigate to the user app directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd user-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the user app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Set up the bank webhook:
   ```bash
   cd ../bank-webhook
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the user app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the user management and transaction application.

2. Start the bank webhook (in a separate terminal or process):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will simulate bank transfers for the application.

## Development

- **Folder Structure**: Each module (user app, bank webhook) can be developed independently within the monorepo structure provided by TurboRepo.
- **Environment Variables**: Modify the `.env` file for different environments (development, staging, production).
